# CS 61B Data Structures Spring 2021

## What is 61B about?
- Writing code that runs efficiently.
  - Good algorithms.
  - Good data structures.
- Writing code efficiently.
  - Designing, building, testing, and debugging large programs.
  - Use of programming tools.
    - git, IntelliJ, JUnit, and various command line tools.
  - Java (not the focus of the course!)

Assumes solid foundation in programming fundamentals, including:
- Object oriented programming, recursion, lists, and trees.

## The Manner in Which Learning Occurs (TMWLO)
- Learning is from doing. Watching lectures is not enough.

Small minority of your learning: 
- Introduction to new material: Lectures / reading.

The vast majority of your learning: 
- **Theory**: Discussion sections, study guides, theory homework.
- **Programming**, Tool Usage, Problem Decomposition: Labs, coding HW, projects.
- **Design**: Projects 2 and 3.

## 61B 4.0 - Course Structure
Phase 1: Programming Intensive Introduction to Java. 
- Weeks 1-4.
- One browser-based programming HW (this HW0 is optional).
- Four labs to introduce you to various tools (starting this week).
- Two projects (proj0 and proj1).

Phase 2: Data Structures.
- Weeks 5-10.
- Incredibly important and foundational material: Expect an CS job interview to lean heavily on this part of the course.
- One programming HWs (HW1) and one exam-prep theory HW (HW2).
  - Applications and deeper insight into data structures.
- One very large solo project (Proj 2), due 4/2. Checkpoint due 3/12.
- Labs:
  - Lab 5: Peer review on project 1.
  - Two labs that implement data structures (hash table and BST).
  - Remaining labs are focused on project 2.

Phase 3: Algorithms and Software Engineering.
- Weeks 10-14
- Project:
  - Proj 3: Build Your Own World: An open ended project where you and a partner build a 2D world with physics according to your own design. Due during lab in the last week of the class.
- Labs devoted to project.
