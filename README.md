## 61B 3.1 - Course Structure
Phase 1: Programming Intensive Introduction to Java. 
- Weeks 1-4.
- One browser-based programming HW (this HW0 is optional).
- Three labs to introduce you to various tools (starting this week).
- Two projects (proj0 and proj1).

Phase 2: Data Structures.
- Weeks 5-10.
- Incredibly important and foundational material: Expect an CS job interview to lean heavily on this part of the course.
- Two programming HWs (HW1, HW2) and one exam-prep theory HW (HW3).
- Applications and deeper insight into data structures.
- One large project (Proj2A/2B), due ~10/16 and ~10/23.
- No autograder. You’re responsible for your code’s correctness.
- Standard labs implement data structures (e.g. hash table).
- Challenge labs are more like hard puzzles using data structures.

Phase 3: Algorithms and Software Engineering
- Weeks 10-14
- Labs: Implement a basic algorithm (e.g. quicksort).
- Two projects:
  - Proj2C/2D: Implementation of an AI algorithm called A* and using your code from Proj 2A/2B/2C to implement browser-based Google Maps clone.
  - Proj 3: Build Your Own World: An open ended project where you build a 2D world with physics according to your own design.
