# Overview
**Review: Typing Rules**
- Compiler allows the memory box to hold any subtype.
- Compiler allows calls based on static type.
- Overriden non-static methods are selected at runtime based on dynamic type.
- For overloaded methods, the method is selected at compile time.

**Subtype Polymorphism** Consider a variable of static type `Deque`. The behavior of calling `deque.method()` depends on the dynamic type. Thus, we could have many subclasses that implement the `Deque` interface, all of which will be able to be called from `deque.method()`.

**Subtype Polymorphism Example** Java doesn't support operator overloading. Some objects cannot be compared by `>` or other operators. Alternatively, we could write a `maxDog()` function inside the `Dog` class, but now we have to write a `max()` function for each class (`maxPenguin()`, `maxCat()` ...) that we want to compare! Remember, our goal is to write a “one true max method” that works for all comparable objects.

**Solution: OurComparable** Interface The solution is to create an interface that contains a `compareTo(Object)` method; let’s call this interface `OurComparable`. Now, our `max()` method can take an `OurComparable[]` parameter, and since we guarantee that any object which extends the interface has all the methods inside the interface, we guarantee that we will always be able to call a `compareTo` method, and that this method will correctly return some ordering of the objects.

Now, we can specify a “one true max method”. Of course, any object that needs to be compared must implement the `compareTo` method. However, instead of re-implementing the `max` logic in every class, we only need to implement the logic for picking the ordering of the objects, given two objects.

> The core idea here is you achieve a generic `max` method for all `OurComparable` objects. You still need to write a `compareTo` method in every class that implements the `OurComparable` interface. You save your work for `max` not how to compare two objects -- `compareTo`.

**Even Better: Java’s In-Built Comparable** Java has an in-built `Comparable` interface that uses generics to avoid any weird casting issues. Plus, `Comparable` already works for things like `Integer`, `Character`, and `String`; moreover, these objects have already implemented a `max`, `min`, etc. method for you. Thus you do not need to re-do work that’s already been done!

**Comparators** The term “Natural Order” is used to refer to the ordering implied by a `Comparable’s` `compareTo` method. However, what if we want to order our Dog objects by something other than `size`? We will instead pass in a `Comparator<T>` interface, which demands a compare() method. We can then implement the `compare()` method anyway we want to achieve our ordering.

  - A comparator wants to compare the other two object.
  - If you want to compare in multiple ways, in Java, you can only use the comparator idea.

# Subtype Polymorphism vs. HOFs
## Subtype Polymorphism
Polymorphism, at its core, means 'many forms'. In Java, polymorphism refers to how objects can have many forms or types. In object-oriented programming, polymorphism relates to how an object can be regarded as an instance of its own class, an instance of its superclass, an instance of its superclass's superclass, and so on.

Suppose we want to write a python program that prints a string representation of the larger of two objects. There are two approaches to this.

Explicit HoF Approach
```py
def print_larger(x, y, compare, stringify):
    if compare(x, y):
        return stringify(x)
    return stringify(y)
```

Subtype Polymorphism Approach
```py
def print_larger(x, y):
    if x.largerThan(y):
        return x.str()
    return y.str()
```
Using the explicit higher order function approach, you have a common way to print out the larger of two objects. In contrast, in the subtype polymorphism approach, **the object itself makes the choices**. The `largerFunction` that is called is dependent on what `x` and `y` actually are.

## Max Function
Java doesn't support operator overloading. We can create an interface that guarantees that any implementing class, like `Dog`, contains a comparison method, which we'll call `compareTo`.

Let's write our interface. We'll specify one method `compareTo`.
```java
public interface OurComparable {
    public int compareTo(Object o);
}
```

We will define its behavior like so:
- Return -1 if `this` < `o`.
- Return 0 if `this` == `o`.
- Return 1 if `this` > `o`.

This code is admittedly quite long, so we can make it much more succinct by modifying our `compareTo` method's behavior:
- Return negative number if `this` < `o`.
- Return 0 if `this` == `o`.
- Return positive number if `this` > `o`.
```java
public int compareTo(Object o) {
    Dog uddaDog = (Dog) o;
    return this.size - uddaDog.size;
}
```

And the `max` method would be like:
```java
public static OurComparable max(OurComparable[] items) {
    int maxDex = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < items.length; i += 1) {
        int cmp = items[i].compareTo(items[maxDex]);
        if (cmp > 0) {
            maxDex = i;
        }
    }
    return items[maxDex];
}
```

- No need for maximization code in every class(i.e. no `Dog.maxDog(Dog[])`) function required
- We have code that operates on multiple types (mostly) gracefully

> Josh put the `max` method in another class `Maximizer`.

## Comparables
Instead of using our own OurComparable, we'll take advantage of an interface that already exists called `Comparable`. `Comparable` is already defined by Java and is used by countless libraries.
```java
public interface Comparable<T> {
	public int compareTo(T obj);
}
```
By using a generic type, this will help us avoid having to cast an object to a specific type! Now, we will rewrite the Dog class to implement the Comparable interface, being sure to update the generic type `T` to Dog:
```java
public class Dog implements Comparable<Dog> {
    ...
    public int compareTo(Dog uddaDog) {
        return this.size - uddaDog.size;
    }
}
```

## Comparator
Java's way of dealing with different types of ordering is by using `Comparator`'s. Since a comparator is an object, the way we'll use `Comparator` is by writing a nested class inside `Dog` that implements the `Comparator` interface.

But first, what's inside this interface?
```java
public interface Comparator<T> {
    int compare(T o1, T o2);
}
```
This shows that the `Comparator` interface requires that any implementing class implements the `compare` method. The rule for `compare` is just like `compareTo`:
- Return negative number if o1 < o2.
- Return 0 if o1 equals o2.
- Return positive number if o1 > o2.

Let's give `Dog` a `NameComparator`. To do this, we can simply defer to `String`'s already defined `compareTo` method.
```java
import java.util.Comparator;

public class Dog implements Comparable<Dog> {
    ...
    public int compareTo(Dog uddaDog) {
        return this.size - uddaDog.size;
    }

    private static class NameComparator implements Comparator<Dog> {
        public int compare(Dog a, Dog b) {
            return a.name.compareTo(b.name);
        }
    }

    public static Comparator<Dog> getNameComparator() {
        return new NameComparator();
    }
}
```
We can retrieve our NameComparator like so:
```java
Comparator<Dog> nc = Dog.getNameComparator();
```

All in all, we have a Dog class that has a private NameComparator class and a method that returns a NameComparator we can use to compare dogs alphabetically by name.

To summarize, interfaces in Java provide us with the ability to make **callbacks**. Sometimes, a function needs the help of another function that might not have been written yet (e.g. `max` needs `compareTo`). A callback function is the helping function (in the scenario, `compareTo`). In some languages, this is accomplished using explicit function passing; in Java, we wrap the needed function in an interface.

A Comparable says, "I want to compare myself to another object". It is imbedded within the object itself, and it defines the **natural ordering** of a type. A Comparator, on the other hand, is more like a third party machine that compares two objects to each other. Since there's only room for one `compareTo` method, if we want multiple ways to compare, we must turn to Comparator.

- `git checkout <pointerToCommit> (<file>)`
  - Conceive `git checkout`'s default argument is `.`
  - Branches, Remote branches (`git remote show`) and hashcode are all pointers to a commit.
  - Use this to quickly regress.

```java
    public static boolean isSameNumber(Integer a, Integer b) {
        return a == b;	// this would fail when a = b > 127 or < -128
						// use a.equals(b) instead.
