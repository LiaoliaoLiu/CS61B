## Hellow World
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
```

1. In Java, all code must be part a class. Every Java file must contain a class declaration*.
2. Classes are defined with "public class CLASSNAME"
3. We use {} to delineate the beginning nad ending of things.
4. We must end lines with a semicolon.
5. The code we want to run must be inside public static void main(String [] args).

## Static Typing
- Variables have declared types, also called their “static type”.
- Variables must be declared before use.
- The compiler ensures type consistency. If types are inconsistent, the program will not compile.
- *Types are checked before the program is even run, allowing developers to catch type errors with ease.*

## Declaring Functions
- Functions must be declared as part of a class in Java.
  - A function that is part of a class is called a "method".
  - So in Java, all functions are methods.
- To define a function in Java, we use "public static".
  - We will see alternate ways of defining functions later.
- All parameters of a function must have a declared type.
  - And the return value of the function must have a declared type.
  - **Functions in Java return only one value.**

## Reflections on Static Typing
The Good:
- Catches certain types of errors, making it easier on the programmer to debug their code.
- Type errors can (almost) never occur on the end user's computer.
- Makes it easier to read and reason about code.
- Code can run more efficiently, e.g. no need to do expensive runtime type checks.

The bad:
- Code is more verbose.
- Code is less general. There is a way around this in Java (generics).

# 1. Introduction to Java
## 1.1 Essentials
### Running a Java Program
The most common way to execute a Java program is to run it through a sequence of two programs. The first is the Java compiler, or javac. The second is the Java interpreter, or java.

![1.1.1](https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/assets/compilation_figure.svg)

```bash
$ javac HelloWorld.java
$ java HelloWorld
Hello World! 
```
You may notice that we include the '.java' when compiling, but we don't include the '.class' when interpreting. This is just the way it is (TIJTWII).

Why make a class file at all?
- .class file has been type checked. Distributed code is safer.
- .class files are 'simpler' for machine to execute. Distributed code is faster.
- No need to give out source. (Reverse is always possible)

### Code Style, Comments, Javadoc
- Size (lines that are not too wide, source files that are not too long)
- Descriptive naming (variables, functions, classes), e.g. variables or functions with names like `year` or `getUserName` instead of `x` or `f`.
- Avoidance of repetitive code: You should almost never have two significant blocks of code that are nearly identical except for a few changes.
- Comments where appropriate. Line comments in Java use the `//` delimiter. Block (a.k.a. multi-line comments) comments use `/*` and `*/`.
- [official style guide](https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/guides/style-guide.html)
- Often, we are willing to incur slight performance penalties, just so that our code is simpler to **grok**. We will highlight examples in later chapters.
- all of your methods and almost all of your classes should be described in a comment using the so-called [Javadoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc) format. In a Javadoc comment:
  - the block comment starts with an extra asterisk, e.g. `/**`.
  - the comment often (but not always) contains descriptive tags.
