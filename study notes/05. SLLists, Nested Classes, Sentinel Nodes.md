# Overview
**Naked Data Structures** `IntLists` are hard to use. In order to use an `IntList` correctly, the programmer must understand and utilize recursion even for simple list related tasks.

**Adding Clothes** First, we will turn the `IntList` class into an `IntNode` class. Then, we will delete any methods in the `IntNode` class. Next, we will create a new class called `SLList`, which contains the instance variable `first`, and this variable should be of type `IntNode`. In essence, we have “wrapped” our `IntNode` with an `SLList`.

**Using SLList** As a user, to create a list, I call the constructor for `SLList`, and pass in the number I wish to fill my list with. The `SLList` constructor will then call the `IntList` constructor with that number, and set first to point to the `IntList` it just created.

**Public vs. Private** We want users to modify our list via `SLList` methods only, and not by directly modifying `first`. We can prevent other users from doing so by setting our variable access to `private`. Writing `private IntNode first;` prevents code in other classes from accessing and modifying `first` (while the code inside the class can still do so).

**Nested Classes** We can also move classes into classes to make nested classes! You can also declare the nested classes to be private as well; this way, other classes can never use this nested class.

**Static Nested Classes** If the `IntNode` class never uses any variable or method of the `SLList` class, we can turn this class static by adding the “static” keyword.

**Recursive Helper Methods** If we want to write a recursive method in `SLList`, how would we go about doing that? After all, the `SLList` is not a naturally recursive data structure like the `IntNode`. A common idea is to write an outer method that users can call. This method calls a private helper method that takes `IntNode` as a parameter. This helper method will then perform the recursion, and return the answer back to the outer method.

**Caching** Previously, we calculated the size of our `IntList` recursively by returning 1 + the size of the rest of our list. This becomes really slow if our list becomes really big, and we repeatedly call our size method. Now that we have an `SLList`, lets simply cache the size of our list as an instance variable! Note that we could not do this before with out `IntList`.

**Empty Lists** With an `SLList`, we can now represent an empty list. We simply set `first` to null and `size` to 0. However, we have introduced some bugs; namely, because `first` is now null, any method that tries to access a property of `first` (like `first.item`) will return a `NullPointerException`. Of course, we can fix this bug by writing code that handles this special case. But there may be many special cases. Is there a better solution?

**Sentinel Nodes** Lets make all `SLList` objects, even empty lists, the same. To do this, lets give each `SLList` a sentinel node, a node that is always there. Actual elements go after the sentinel node, and all of our methods should respect the idea that sentinel is always the first element in our list.

**Invariants** An invariant is a fact about a data structure that is guaranteed to be true (assuming there are no bugs in your code). This gives us a convenient checklist every time we add a feature to our data structure. Users are also guaranteed certain properties that they trust will be maintained. For example, an `SLList` with a sentinel node has at least the following invariants:

- The sentinel reference always points to a sentinel node.
- The front item (if it exists), is always at `sentinel.next.item`.
- The size variable is always the total number of items that have been added.

# SLLists
```java
public class SLList {
    public IntNode first; //then We change it to a sentinel

    public SLList(int x) {
        first = new IntNode(x, null);
    }

	public void addFirst(int x) {
        first = new IntNode(x, first);
    }
}
```

## addFirst and getFirst
The curious reader might object and say that the `IntList` would be just as easy to use if we simply wrote an `addFirst` method. Try to write an `addFirst` method to the `IntList` class. You'll find that the resulting method is tricky as well as inefficient.
```java
public class IntList {
	public int first;
	public IntList rest;

	public IntList(int f, IntList r) {
		first = f;
		rest = r;
	}

	public void addFirst(int x) {
        tmp = new IntNode(first, rest);
		first = x;
		rest = tmp;
    }
}
```

## Public vs. Private
Here you don't want others to mess up around the implementation details. To prevent and most importantly indicate they cross the abstraction barrier, we can modify the `SLList` class so that the `first` variable is declared with the `private` keyword.

- Private variables and methods can only be accessed by code inside the same `.java` file, e.g. in this case `SLList.java`.
- It may seem a little silly to restrict access. After all, the only thing that the `private` keyword does is break programs that otherwise compile.
- However, in large software engineering projects, the `private` keyword is an invaluable signal that certain pieces of code should be ignored (and thus need not be understood) by the end user.
- Likewise, the `public` keyword should be thought of as a declaration that a method is available and will work **forever** exactly as it does now.

*When you create a `public` member (i.e. method or variable), be careful, because you're effectively committing to supporting that member's behavior exactly as it is now, forever.*

## Nested Classes
- Having a nested class has no meaningful effect on code performance, and is simply a tool for keeping code organized.
- Declaring a nested class as `static` means that methods inside the static class can not access any of the members of the enclosing class. 
- In this case, it means that no method in `IntNode` would be able to access `first`, `addFirst`, or `getFirst`.
```java
public class SLList {
       public static class IntNode {
            public int item;
            public IntNode next;
            public IntNode(int i, IntNode n) {
                item = i;
                next = n;
            }
       }

       private IntNode first;
...
```
- This saves a bit of memory, because each IntNode no longer needs to keep track of how to access its enclosing SLList.
- _If you don't use any instance members of the outer class, make the nested class static._

## addLast() and size()
```java
/** Returns the size of the list starting at IntNode p. */
private static int size(IntNode p) {
    if (p.next == null) {
        return 1;
    }

    return 1 + size(p.next);
}

public int size() {
    return size(first);
}
```

Here, we have two methods, both named `size`. This is allowed in Java, since they have different parameters. We say that two methods with the same name but different signatures are **overloaded**.

## Sentinel Nodes
In order to implement empty list and avoid special cases (Human beings only have so much working memory), a cleaner, though less obvious solution, is to make it so that all `SLLists` are the "same", even if they are empty. We can do this by *creating a special node that is always there*, which we will call a **sentinel node**. The sentinel node will hold a value, which we won't care about.

![sentinel_sllist](https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/chap2/fig22/three_item_sentenlized_SLList.png)

```java
public void addLast(int x) {
    size += 1;
    IntNode p = sentinel;
    while (p.next != null) {
        p = p.next;
    }

    p.next = new IntNode(x, null);
}
// tho you have to change get first too.
```

## Invariant
An invariant is a fact about a data structure that is guaranteed to be true (assuming there are no bugs in your code).

A `SLList` with a sentinel node has at least the following invariants:

- The `sentinel` reference always points to a sentinel node.
- The front item (if it exists), is always at `sentinel.next.item`.
- The `size` variable is always the total number of items that have been added.

Invariants make it easier to reason about code, and also give you specific goals to strive for in making sure your code works.

A true understanding of how convenient sentinels are will require you to really dig in and do some implementation of your own. You'll get plenty of practice in project 1. However, I recommend that you wait until after you've finished the next section of this book before beginning project 1.

# Q&A
- [In SLList, why you use `size(p)` not `size(this)`](https://youtu.be/46DJBZC5Yvc?t=709)
  - `this` here is a SLList.
  - SLList only stores a sentinel and it has no `next`.
  - Only sentinel, a `IntNode`, has a next.
  - You can do `size(this)` in the nested IntNode class.
- [make import implicit/impossible](https://youtu.be/46DJBZC5Yvc?t=998)
  - You cannot implicit import.
  - If you have a class and don't want others import it, delete the `public` keyword.
- [`size += 1` or `addToSize()`](https://youtu.be/46DJBZC5Yvc?t=1353)
  - I prefer the first, I will do the later one only I want to hide some details so that I don't need to always think about it.
- [why `while (p != null)` in `addLast` don't work](https://youtu.be/46DJBZC5Yvc?t=1949)
  - You just assign a local variable, without linking the node.
- [use static variable to cache size in `IntList`](https://youtu.be/46DJBZC5Yvc?t=2603)
  - We will run into some problems:
  - 1.When we should update size, you need manually add it by `globalSize += 1` after every new IntList added.
  - 2.You only have one `globalSize`, but ideally you will have multiple IntLists (not linked).
  - 3.Add a size for every instance is a pain in the xxx to maintain the list.
