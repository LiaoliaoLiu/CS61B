# Lecture
- [The topic is to teach you how to deal with the large scale](https://youtu.be/VsHQRkH0SW8?t=408)
  - One thing that's hard is that, in a lecture, it's hard to find a task which is small enough to actually fit in the lecture but big enough to show the big picture issues.
  - These lectures are heavily inspired by "A Philosophy of Software Design".
- [The different between CS and Math is that there is a machine that brings the creativity work into life](https://youtu.be/VsHQRkH0SW8?t=648)
- [John Osterhot's two key tools handling complexity](https://youtu.be/VsHQRkH0SW8?t=773)
  - Making code simpler and more obvious.
    - Eliminating special cases, e.g. sentinel nodes.
  - Encapsulation into modules.
    - In a modular design, creators of one "module" can use other module without knowing how they work.
- [The nature of complexity](https://youtu.be/VsHQRkH0SW8?t=954)
  - "anything related to the structure of a software system that makes it hard to understand and **modify** the system."
  - Understanding how the code works.
  - The amount of time it takes to make small improvements.
  - Finding what needs to be modified to make an improvement.
  - Difficult to fix one bug without introducing another.
  - "If the software is hard to understand and modify, then it is complicated. If it is easy to understand and modify, then it is simple".
- [A system may have a few pieces that are highly complex, but if nobody even looks at that code, then the overall impact is minimal.](https://youtu.be/VsHQRkH0SW8?t=1703)
  - `C = sum(c_p * t_p)` for each part p.
    - `c_p` is the complexity of part p.
    - `t_p` is the time spent working on part p.
- [Symptoms of Complexity](https://youtu.be/VsHQRkH0SW8?t=1805)
  - Change amplification: A simple change requires modification in many places.
  - Cognitive load: How much you need to know in order to make a change.
    - Note: This is not the same as number of lines of code. Often MORE lines of code actually makes code simpler, because it is more narrative.
      - Incidently that's why Josh doesn't like `i++`.
      - more lines of code and varible for lower cognitive load is better for two reasons:
        - The cost in performance is likely to be very small (some constant amount).
        - Modern compilers might just optimize out the inefficient completely.
  - Unknown unknowns: The worst type of complexity. This occurs when it's not even clear what you need to know in order to make modifications.
    - Common in large code bases.
    - You've felt this a lot in Gitlet!

- [Complexity comes slowly](https://youtu.be/VsHQRkH0SW8?t=2505)
  - Ousterhout recommends a zero tolerance philosophy.
- [Tactical programming](https://youtu.be/VsHQRkH0SW8?t=2568)
  - Much of the programming that you've down, Ousterhout would descrtible as "tactical"
  - "You main focus is to get something working, such as a new feature or bug fix."
  - The problem with tactical programming:
    - You don't spend problem thinking about overall design.
    - You introduce tons of little complexityies. (many codes do the similar things)
      - Refactoring takes more time.
- [Strategic programming](https://youtu.be/VsHQRkH0SW8?t=2674)
  - Working code isn't enough.
  - The most important thing is the long term structure of the system.
  - Adding complexities to achieve short term time games is unacceptable.
  - On project 3, try to plan ahead.
  - For each new class/task:
    - Try a few different ideas.
    - When you feel like you have found something that feels clean, then fully implement that idea.
    - In real systems: Try to image how things might need to be changed in the future, and make sure your design can handle such changes.
      - In project 3, you'll need to support both input from the keyboard AND input from a String.
- [Stragtegic Programming is Very Hard](https://youtu.be/VsHQRkH0SW8?t=2818)
  - Now matter how careful you try to be, there will be mistakes in your design.
  - Avoid the temptation to patch around these mistakes. Instead, fix the design.
  - It's impossible to design large software systems entirely in advance.
